Serial Software flasher for the Maxim USIP Lite and USIP Pro processors

This is a simple command-line flash image transferral program for these processors.

It was written for/on Mac so might need some tweaking to run on Linux or other *nix-style OS.

It's a while since I wrote it or looked at a USIP but this will likely only work during the more 'open' lifecycle phases.

It may need a key supplied. I have a feeling RCS support is partial, but present.
There is source for an RCS given in hello_world, but I don't have the tools to turn this into a USIP binary at present.

I hope somebody gets some use out of this someday!
